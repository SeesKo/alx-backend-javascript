# 0x02. ES6 classes

## Description

JavaScript classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JavaScript are syntactic sugar over the existing prototype-based inheritance. They make it easier to create and manage objects and are often used in object-oriented programming.
