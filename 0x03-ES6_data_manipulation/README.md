# 0x03. ES6 data manipulation

## Description

ES6 introduces several new features and improvements for data manipulation in JavaScript. Some of the key features include:

1. **Arrow Functions:** These provide a concise syntax for defining anonymous functions, which can be very handy for inline data transformations.
2. **Let and Const:** These allow block-scoped variable declarations (let for mutable variables and const for immutable variables), making data manipulation within blocks more predictable.
3. **Template Literals:** These provide an easier way to manipulate strings, making string interpolation and multiline strings simpler.
4. **Destructuring:** This allows you to extract data from arrays or objects into distinct variables, making it easier to work with complex data structures.
5. **Rest and Spread Operators:** These allow you to manipulate arrays and objects more flexibly, either by combining elements (spread) or by gathering them into arrays (rest).
6. **Array and Object Methods:** ES6 introduced new methods for arrays and objects that make common operations like mapping, filtering, and merging more concise and readable.
