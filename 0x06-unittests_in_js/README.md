# 0x06. Unittests in JS

## Project Overview

This project involves creation and execution of unit tests in JavaScript using the `Mocha` testing framework, along with `Chai` for assertions, and `Sinon` for spies, stubs, and mocks. The goal is to help the learner understand how to effectively write and organize tests, ensuring that their code is both reliable and maintainable.

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 18.04
- Node 12.x.x
- Code should use the `js` extension
- Tested with `npm run test *.test.js`
