# 0x01. ES6 Promises

## Description

Promises in JavaScript are a way to handle asynchronous operations. They represent a value that may be available now, in the future, or never. Promises were introduced to improve upon the callback-based approach to handling asynchronous operations, making asynchronous code more readable and easier to manage.
